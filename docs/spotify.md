# Spotify Integration

Cliamp can stream your [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/) library directly through its audio pipeline. EQ, visualizer, and all effects apply. Requires a [Spotify Premium](https://www.spotify.com/premium/) account.

## Setup

### Creating your client ID

1. Go to [developer.spotify.com/dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard) and log in
2. Click **Create app**
3. Fill in a name (e.g. "cliamp") and description (anything works)
4. Add `http://127.0.0.1:19872/login` as a **Redirect URI**
5. Check **Web API** under "Which API/SDKs are you planning to use?"
6. Click **Save**
7. Open your app's **Settings** and copy the **Client ID**

### Configuring cliamp

Add your client ID to `~/.config/cliamp/config.toml`:

```toml
[spotify]
client_id = "your_client_id_here"
bitrate = 320
```

`bitrate` is optional. If omitted, cliamp uses `320`. Supported values are `96`, `160`, and `320`. Non-positive values (≤ 0) are treated as `320`. Other positive values are rounded to the nearest supported bitrate.

Run `cliamp`, select Spotify as a provider, and press Enter to sign in. Credentials are cached at `~/.config/cliamp/spotify_credentials.json`. Subsequent launches refresh silently.

## Usage

Once authenticated, Spotify appears as a provider alongside Navidrome and local playlists. Press `Esc`/`b` to open the provider browser and select Spotify.

Your Spotify playlists are listed in the provider panel. Navigate with the arrow keys and press `Enter` to load one. Tracks are streamed through cliamp's audio pipeline, so EQ, visualizer, mono, and all other effects work exactly as with local files.

## Controls

When focused on the provider panel:

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `Up` `Down` / `j` `k` | Navigate playlists |
| `Enter` | Load the selected playlist |
| `Tab` | Switch between provider and playlist focus |
| `Esc` / `b` | Open provider browser |

After loading a playlist you return to the standard playlist view with all the usual controls (seek, volume, EQ, shuffle, repeat, queue, search, lyrics).

## Playlists

Only playlists in your Spotify library are shown. This includes playlists you've created and playlists you've saved (followed). If a public playlist doesn't appear, open Spotify and click **Save** on it first. There's no need to copy tracks to a new playlist.

## Troubleshooting

- **"OAuth failed"**: Make sure your redirect URI is exactly `http://127.0.0.1:19872/login` in the Spotify dashboard (no trailing slash).
- **Playlist not showing**: You must save/follow the playlist in Spotify for it to appear. Only your library playlists are listed.
- **Playback issues**: Spotify integration requires a Premium account. Free accounts cannot stream.
- **Re-authenticate**: Delete `~/.config/cliamp/spotify_credentials.json` and restart cliamp to trigger a fresh login.

## Requirements

- Spotify Premium account
- A registered app at [developer.spotify.com/dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)
- No additional system dependencies beyond cliamp itself
